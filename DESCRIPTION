Description: 
    ckdPrediction provides a machine-learning pipeline for predicting
    chronic kidney disease (CKD) from tabular clinical and laboratory
    measurements in the kidney disease dataset.
    The package wraps the full workflow, including:
    (i) data cleaning and processes of the raw CSV file 
        (missing rate evaluation/missing value processing/train–test splitting);
    (ii) supervised model fitting with random forest, ridge logistic regression,
         and support vector machines;
    (iii) threshold-based new data CKD prediction with trained models;
    (iv) model evaluation with confusion matrix/ROC,PRC curves/F1-Score based
         thresholds optimization;
    (v) model interpretation via feature importance and SHAP-based explanations;
    (vi) model comparison using multiple performance metrics.
    Disclaimer: The R package is only for study purpose, 
    and must not be used for any real clinical decision making.
